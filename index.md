Researcher, Data and Image Analyst with Python and MATLAB Coding skills for **_big data_**, **_Image_** and **_text mining_**. 



### Skills:

* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* EDA (Exploratory data analysis)
* Big-Data handling
* MySQL
* Collaborative work
* Analytical and problem solving. 
* Verbal and writing skills

### Computer Language Skills:

* Python                                       
* Matlab
* Javascript                                   
* C.

### Library Experiences:   
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, OpenCV and NLTK.

## Data Analysis Works:
* **Lending analysis for banking and financial data:** The Case study is based on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It is mainly banking and financial understanding to minimise the risk factor of charged off loan in the lending customar. The analysis is to find the parameters which are the driving factor of detecting the defaulters from the past datasets.

* **The USA based BoomBikes sharing case study to accelerate the revenue earning:** The analysis will help to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

* Doctoral Researcher 
> Biomimetics and Intelligent System Group (BISG), University of Oulu, Finland.
* Assistant Professor  
> Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, India.

### Grants and Fellowship: 

* High Performance Computing-Europa3(_HPC-Europa3_) grant for a collaboration work in the University of Turin, Italy for nine weeks.

* Doctoral Researcher Fellowship, Funded by Infotech-DP Oulu.


## Research Achievements in Informatics:  

* _**Detection of intra-family coronavirus genome sequences through graphical representation and artificial neural network:**_ CGR representation of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV2, MERS and Alpha CoV sequences. A combine performance of CGR and ANN to detect the virus sequences. Encoding the genome sequence into an organized, well represented small data. CGR transforms the genome sequence into short even less than 1% of actual size.

* _**Clustering and classification of virus sequence through music communication protocol and wavelet transform :**_ Auditory representation of Influenza, Ebola and Coronavirus sequences are focused. Clustering of auditory sequence helps in prominent classification of the viruses compared to genome sequences. MIDI conversion and DWT based genome signal processing are presented.
